defmodule SmeeView.AttributeServices do

  @moduledoc """
  This module can extracts the `<AttributeService>` elements in entity metadata as "aspect" structs, and then
  process and filter the results.

  Aspects can be extracted with three functions:

  * Views, via `view/2` are lists of aspects
  * Prisms, via `prism/2` are maps of entity IDs to views
  * There is also `view_one/2` which returns the first aspect of one entity

  Aspects can be extracted from `Smee.Metadata` structs, `Smee.Entity` structs, or lists of aspects, Metadata and Entity
    structs.

  The other functions in this module are intended to be applied to collections of aspect structs - for working with
    individual aspects, please look at the appropriate Aspect module.
